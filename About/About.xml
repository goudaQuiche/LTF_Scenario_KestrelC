	<description>Also called "The Swallow", that vessel crew is composed of 2 humans and 1 lanius.
	
This model was modified by pirates to utilize newly discovered technology. It can clone lost crewmembers and stun enemies. Unfortunately, It's crashed right now.

In this scenario inspired by Faster than Light, you will start with :
- 1 cloning bay (1 phenodrill, 1 clone vat, 3 meat grinders)
- 1 chemfuel power generator, 2 batteries
- 30 industrial components
- 1 basic rifle, 1 revolver, 1 wooden spear
- 1 cat

In the surroundings are scattered :
- 500 Chemfuel
- 500 Steel

You will start with electricity because your guys are not cavemen after all. They have been in space and hope to escape from this planet.
